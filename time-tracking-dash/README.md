### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
  - Custom Props
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library (Overkill for this, but I need more practice with it)
  - useContext
  - createContext
  - useReducer
  - Custom Hook(s)
  - and more!
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Vite Build Tool
- Axios - HTTP Client
  - Not needed at all here since I'm just reading from static json. But, I may whip up a simple node server just for fun

### Continued development

I want and need to focus more on how to make my components for project agnostic/polymorphic. I would also like to continue honing in my vanilla css skills. Tailwind is great, but i've fallen behind on alot of the new and exciting stuff!

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is always one of my go-to's for explanations
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - I always have this open for a quick reference!
