- CSS
  - Custom Props
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Vite Build Tool

### Continued development

I want and need to focus more on how to make my components for project agnostic/polymorphic. I would also like to continue honing in my vanilla css skills. Tailwind is great, but i've fallen behind on alot of the new and exciting stuff!

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is always one of my go-to's for explanations
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - I always have this open for a quick reference!
